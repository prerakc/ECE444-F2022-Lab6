Project 1 Test Case:

https://github.com/ECE444-2022Fall/project-1-web-application-design-education-pathways-group-7-waterfall/blob/5e46191e2562cd5612b925ed9bbe06e3c99be5de/Education_Pathways/tests/test_app.py#L69

Advantages of TDD: 

- Encourages well-architectured and modularized code to allow for testing of various code blocks
- Tests cases can supplement source code documentation
- Easier to maintain and refactor code
- High test coverages develops confidence in the codebase and application functionality
- Test suite acts as automated regression testing
- Promotes collaboration as team members can edit each other's code and validate changes against the test suite

Disadvantages of TDD:

- Potentially challenging to write tests beyond the unit test level
- Test suite needs to be maintained when requirements or external dependencies change
- Initially slows down development
- Creating test fixtures can be tedious and time consuming
- May be difficult to mock certain services
- Requires buy-in and correct execution from the entire team
